Compiler Theory Project â€“ FCIS

This project was completed as part of the Compiler Theory course at the Faculty of Computers and Information Sciences (FCIS). It includes two main milestones:

Milestone 1 - Scanner (Lexical Analysis):
A lexical analyzer that reads source code and produces a stream of tokens using regular expressions and a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

Note: The DFA was implemented without a trap (dead) state

Milestone 2 - Parser (Syntax Analysis):
A syntax analyzer that parses the token stream based on a context-free grammar to validate code structure and build a parse tree.
